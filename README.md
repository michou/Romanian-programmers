This implements the popular **Romanian (Programmers)** keyboard layout for physical keyboards (USB,
Bluetooth) for Android. It only works on Android 4.4+.

The code is based on https://github.com/tialaramex/BritishKeyboard (despite the original fork) and
uses the undocumented (?) `OVERLAY` keyboard type, although it might have worked with a `FULL`
keyboard type as well.
